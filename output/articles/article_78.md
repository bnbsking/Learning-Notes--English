## The Unexpected Storm

The sky was **sporadic** with flashes of lightning, a warning of the tempest to come. We could only **speculate** on the storm's ferocity, but the atmosphere, thick with humidity, suggested it would be a powerful one. My neighbour, a rather pompous **snob**, dismissed the threat, declaring that such storms were common and nothing to worry about. He was sure to **stop at nothing to do** his gardening in his perfectly manicured lawn.

Suddenly, the wind began to howl, and the first drops of rain, fat and heavy, began to **shatter** against the windows. A tree branch, torn and **rip**ped from its trunk, crashed onto his precious roses. He would never admit that this was his fault of not watching the weather forecast.

The rain intensified, and the river, usually a gentle **ribbon** of water, began to rise. The tension was **simmering** as we watched, knowing the floods were imminent. We grabbed what we could. My priority was to **salvage** my grandfather's antique clock.

As the water rose, the old stone bridge crumbled, revealing a large **slab** beneath the surface. We packed our bags, ready to **shed** our possessions to avoid further loss. Finding a **haven** became the most crucial thing. A local **politician**, always eager to appear helpful, promised that relief was on its way, even though his words **waver**ed slightly, revealing his own anxiety. He seemed like a **straggler** in an unfamiliar place.

The rain finally ceased, leaving behind a devastated landscape. The river was now a vast, churning body of water. Luckily, a small **shoal** of land, just above the water level, offered some temporary respite. We are lucky that we were able to get a **specimen** of life. The world was changed forever. We now live in a more **secular** manner, where our priorities are more simple: survival.
