# A Hasty Hike on the Cliff

**Here we go**! We're about to embark on a challenging hike. We **had better** pack our bags, as the weather report warns of **harsh** conditions ahead. The trail is along a dramatic **cliff**, and the wind can be quite fierce, so we'll need to **hang on** tight.

I've heard that the path is quite **haphazard**, with no clear markings. It also **precipitates** several dangers. We should be mindful of loose **sediment** on the slopes. I wouldn't want to **precipitate** a fall. The terrain itself is quite treacherous. If you are **headstrong**, be very careful as the edge is not far off.

Remember, we are entering a rather remote area. We need to be careful and avoid anything that might be considered **indiscreet**. It's best to avoid being alone in case of a **homicide**, or similar emergency.

Don't **hang up** your coat just yet; we are not back to **heaven**. And if any of us gets into trouble, we cannot call for help as our phones have no reception. Our journey might **swamp with** issues.

I heard a dog **howl** at the house, while I was packing. It seems that they are **harassing** the locals. 

Before we get started, let's do some **sanitization**.

If we get lost, we must make sure to **hoist** a flag to signal our location.

Why the urgency? **How come** we have to rush? 

I **cape** this journey, as it will be challenging.

The person is **wilful** and wants to walk faster.

Be aware of the **manacles** and remember to **uncuff** the chains after our journey.

I hope that the plants from **horticulture** will not be the cause of my discomfort.

We will **growl** when we have hunger.
