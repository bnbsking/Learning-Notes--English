## The Abandoned Shack and the Scapegoat

The old **shanty** stood on the outskirts of town, a **shabby** and neglected structure. Its paint was peeling, and a lone **shrub** stubbornly clung to the cracked **floor** in front. **Hardly** anyone ventured near it, its **solitary** existence a reminder of forgotten times. 

Inside, dust motes **sparkled** in the weak sunlight that managed to penetrate the grimy windows. A **sieve** lay discarded in the corner, hinting at some forgotten task. A **stain**, the color of dried blood, marked a **slab of** the wooden **floor**, a silent testament to some past event. The whole place had a **perverse** aura, a feeling of things gone wrong.

Rumours swirled around the town about what had happened there. Some said it was the site of a **savage** crime, others whispered of illicit activities. The local mayor, facing criticism for the town's economic downturn, desperately tried to find a **scapegoat** to deflect blame. He was eager to **seek a second term**, and the accusations were getting in the way of his chances.

One day, a young boy, a known **straggler** from the town's youth, was rumored to have **snitched to A that** the mayor might be involved in an illegal business and has been involved in **smuggle**. The boy was then accused of doing things that the mayor does not like, and was accused for being the reason for the problems the town faced. He quickly became the prime suspect, and the town turned against him.

The case of the town's problems didn't have a **silver bullet**, there were no quick fixes. The boy's story **wavered** under pressure, and there was no easy way to fix what happened. The **secular** nature of justice ensured a fair judgement, which the mayor really did not like.

The boy's family was in financial crisis. The **surcharge** of the family's debts lead to them moving to a new **stationery** place. His family started to sell **solvent** to make some money but the **surge** of problems never stopped. The boy was then **hardly** accepted into the society.

The young **specimen** found a job at the local store. However, his work was **superintend** by a man with a **semblance** of power and authority. But one day, the boy decided to **swerve** away from the rules and **rocket** away from his problems and run. He ran. The boy eventually left the town. He thought he had escaped the problems and the negativity that the town and people gave him, but it didn't feel like an escape for him.
