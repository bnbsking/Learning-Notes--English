## A Rookie's First Voyage

The **cruise** ship, a **conspicuous** giant on the horizon, was about to set sail. As a **rookie** on the crew, I was filled with a mixture of excitement and **distress**. My first task was to assist the **attendants** in preparing the cabins. I was eager to **attain** a good reputation, so I tried to be **thoughtful** and helpful.

The atmosphere onboard was **fascinating**. Guests in **assorted** **attire** were milling about, some **enthusiastic about** the journey while others seemed a little apprehensive. I tried to **assimilate** into the environment, **be conscious of** the established protocols, and **understand** the expectations.

My role often required me to **defer** to the more experienced members of the crew. Mr. Henderson, the **janitor**, always seemed to know everything. He was an **aficionado of** the sea, he often **dwelt** on tales of past voyages and the wonders of the ocean, stories that completely **captivate**d me.

Later that day, I ran into some trouble. I accidently knocked over a tray of drinks and made a mess. I prepared to be **banish**ed for my carelessness. To my surprise, the captain, a stern but fair man, seemed to just **turn a blind eye to** the situation. 

One of the passengers, a **christian** family, **console**d me and encouraged me to **believe** in myself. I realized my **conscience** was clear and was determined not to **destroy** my hopes, even though it was a very **blatant** mistake.

In the evening, the ship hosted a movie night. The movieâ€™s **antagonist** was a **carnivore** creature, the **tentacle**s of which reminded me of the underwater world. I had to **believe** in my ability to overcome challenges, because I knew I would be able to **abide in** the journey and **reside in** the ship. 

I **idolize** the captain for his experience. He always reminds us to **take a long-term view** and think about the goals. He **ascertain**ed that we were never going to **destroy** a **convoy** and was always reminding us of a **cruise missile** during the sea war.
**Anyhow**, the journey was also **visible** from the high grounds and I could not be **invisible** to its **foe**. The captain's wisdom would **baffle** any of the challenges and I knew I would be successful because I am **perceptive** enough to learn from others.

The journey continued, I knew the captain would **attain** the best and would never be **exile**d or **erupt** on any one. I will remain an **apprentice** until the time comes for me to step up. Even the **baby** was excited with me.
