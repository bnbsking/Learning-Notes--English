## The Weight of Choices in the City

The **urban area**, once vibrant and full of promise, has become shadowed by the **economic circumstances** of recent years. Many of the buildings, once grand, are now **dilapidated**, casting a **dingy** pall over the streets. This **destructive** environment is a direct **consequence** of the **corrupt** practices that have taken root, fueled by **deceit** and the actions of those who seek to **defraud** others.

The future feels uncertain, and many citizens find themselves **in a dilemma**, struggling to **make up their minds** about what to do. The **indecisive** nature of leaders has only served to exacerbate the problem. They seem unable to **decide** on crucial policies, often choosing to **postpone** difficult decisions. The **determinant** of this stagnation appears to be a lack of vision and a **dissimilar** approach to resolving the issues.

Living in this environment, people often **be at the mercy of** circumstances beyond their control. Even the simple act of walking outside can be unpleasant, as the **drizzle** often turns into a persistent rain. The **scarcity** of resources, coupled with the rising cost of living, makes life even harder. A small **deposit** of money may not be enough to help them survive.

The **dormitory** that I live in seems to **separate** me from this **metropolitan area**, with its **dome** like roof. Some people try to **refine** their appearance, putting on **make-up** to feel better. You could almost **deem** this an **ornament**, a way to briefly escape the harsh realities. However, I believe the **dose** of reality and its **consequence** will not **melt** away.

Despite these challenges, a **holy** feeling somehow **emerge**, a reminder of what's important. I will **deduct** those negative feelings and hope for a brighter future. What happens to you is not entirely clear, and you will **spread** this news, that you must be careful of your surroundings.

As for me, when I **conclude**, I will try to **orchestrate** a plan, even when I feel **faint**. It is time to **distinguish** myself from the others. I think it is time to start **exercise**. The one thing I can't do is **quarrel about** the future. Even though there might be a **collocation** of things that need to be done, I will try my best to **harbor** a positive attitude.

We are also told by the **deceiver** to **segregate** ourselves, even when things **supersede** to our disadvantages. The **divine** intervention might be needed here.

**Note**:
1.  "Suggest 1" : I understand this may be a vocabulary but I did not include it in the article as "suggest" is a very common word.
2.  "Drain off 2": This is a phrasal verb and I did not add it to the article because it can be interpreted as "drain away".
