## The Gardener's Dilemma

The **gorgeous** sunrise painted the **plateau** in **breathtaking** hues of orange and pink. However, Mr. Henderson, the head gardener, remained in a **gloomy** mood. A **plague** of aphids had infested his prize-winning roses, and the situation felt **precarious**. He knew it was **imperative** to act quickly.

His initial instinct was to **plunge** into action, but a sense of **defer** overcame him. He decided to **investigate** the problem thoroughly. The leaves, once vibrant, were now beginning to **ruffle** and wither. He imagined the **petals** of his beloved roses, once **pliable** and soft, now starting to **mar** their beauty. 

His first thought was to **seek** a **band-aid** solution. He was tempted to **pinch** the offending aphids off one by one. However, his younger assistant, Sarah, offered a more sustainable approach. She suggested using a natural insecticide, arguing that it was more **pertinent to** the health of the garden. 

Mr. Henderson, though a seasoned veteran in **horticulture**, found himself constantly learning. Sarah, with her eagerness and enthusiasm, had a way of **convince** him. He had to **polish** his techniques, or Sarah, would probably **parody** him (in a good way!).

The discussion then took a turn. Sarah pointed out the need to **cultivate** a better understanding of the ecosystem. The absence of ladybugs, natural predators of aphids, had contributed to the problem. "We need to consider our whole ecosystem," she said. This would **entail** learning to bring new life into the garden.

A **harsh** silence fell. Mr. Henderson, who had been a **nationalist** and wanted to protect every **plank** and **livestock** on his land, felt this was an attack on his heritage. Sarah's approach did not come from a place of **sad** judgement, she spoke of change and betterment. The **closeness** of their relationship was **undoubtedly** a factor, however he would not budge. Mr. Henderson knew the job of a gardener was not to **preach** change, but to **polish** the present and care for the future.

The situation had begun to **irritating** him. The thought of having to **pluralize** his efforts. He felt a **piercing** need for the issue to be over. He felt an itch in his foot, a signal of the aphids to begin to **patrol** his land. 

He eventually agreed to **seek** advice, and felt the weight on his shoulder lift. However, as he pondered his **ancestor's** approach, he realized that the problem was not simple. As he stared down the **corridor**, he realized the depth of the issue.

"We'll get through this," Sarah offered from the **patio**, her voice gentle. "It's not a perfect solution, but it's what we can do right now." She was correct. He needed to find peace. Mr. Henderson decided to go in and **plumb** the issue further. The issue, to Mr. Henderson, was in the **proximity** of his past. 

The **personnel** were at his disposal, he did not need a **periscope** to see the solution. The task at hand was clear: **seek** the best path forward. It was **magnificent** to see the potential of his garden once again, and his determination to **flaunt** the issue over time had him smiling once again.
