## A Shadow of Doubt

The **competition** for the annual town photography **contest** was fierce. Many residents had dedicated weeks, even months, honing their skills. This year, the prize was an **enormous** sum of money, enough to potentially **do away with** the necessity of having a job, which, for some, felt like a daily **chore**.

Old Mr. Henderson, a local legend, was rumored to be in the running. He was a talented photographer, though his age had begun to show. Some whispered that he practically **had his foot in the grave**, but his passion for his craft burned bright. He lived in a cozy house, and one of the interesting features of his house was the **basement**, which served as his darkroom. He had also received an **booklet** explaining the rules.

The judge, a stern woman known for her uncompromising standards, had released the **caveat**: originality and emotional impact would be prioritized. This seemed to **call for** a more creative approach than simply beautiful landscapes. One of the local children asked Mr Henderson to take photos in a local **chapel**, and he agreed.

The **chasm** between the hopeful competitors widened as the deadline approached. Many wondered what sort of image would capture the judge's attention. He was also suffering from **cancer** and the constant coughing had damaged his **windpipe**. His doctor advised him to be very careful, because the stress could **result in** further health issues.

Mr. Hendersonâ€™s health was deteriorating, which was what his neighbours were talking about. The gossip did not have any effect on his ability to focus on the photography. He decided not to attend the award ceremony. The judges announced that they'd had to **castrate** some of the entries because of their lack of quality. His photo, however, was announced as the winner, a poignant image of a lone tree against a stormy sky, a stark reminder of the fragility of life.
