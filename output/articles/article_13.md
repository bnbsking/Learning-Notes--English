## A Melancholic Morning at the Museum

The **beginner** guide to the natural history museum seemed to have a **penetrating** effect on me this morning. I was particularly interested in the **aquatic** **habitat** section, but I felt a sense of **melancholic** dread, as I **grieve for** the loss of the previous exhibitions. My initial **estimation** of the day was not promising. I had arrived late, feeling **exhausted** after a sleepless night, and had been completely **bewildered** by the overly **talkative** **receptionist**. I was **worrying about** several problems that would not **discharge** easily.

The first exhibit featured an **archaic** species of fish that, according to the **docent**, was almost **obliterated** from its natural **area** due to a changing environment. The fish, which was **herbivorous**, used to **dwell in** a vibrant coral reef. Now, its **habitat** was slowly **eradicating**.

This, coupled with the museum's general atmosphere, filled me with **dismay**. A museum, after all, is supposed to **reassure** you of the beauty of the world, not make you feel like its eventual **wipe out** is inevitable. I tried to **absorb** the information, to exercise my **cognitive function**, but I found it difficult to **reach** that state.

My mind kept drifting to another topic: the ongoing debate of animal rights. I had become **passionate about** this issue over the last few years, but I didn't want to become a **fanatic**. I have a friend who is a **terrorist** for animal protection and I fear that I may **be really into** the same path, but I wanted to avoid this.

I did find one small **asset** to the morning: an **autograph** from a famous marine biologist. It was the only thing that made me feel, at least for a moment, I wasn't just some **short-sighted** person.

The museum, I later learned, had been built on land that the city council was trying to **evict** some of the citizens to expand. The biologist, a man known for his **compassionate** work, also mentioned he had been receiving **condolence** emails from the public.

In the end, I left the museum feeling more **melancholic** than when I arrived. The day made me feel more like the **opponent** of the **realm** of the **appliance** that I need to **eat** every day, rather than a participant. Itâ€™s all that I **want** when I see it.
