# The Demise of the Old Manor

The old manor stood **formidable** against the encroaching storm, a silhouette etched against the bruised sky. It had seen better days, that much was clear. A deep **abrasion** marred the stone facade, and the windows, once bright, now seemed to **flicker** with a **listless** glow. It was a **facility** of history, but the ravages of time had taken their toll.

I was drawn to the place by a local **mystery** - a young woman had been found dead there, and the circumstances were, to say the least, perplexing. Rumors of a curse, of a lingering **wrath**, and the presence of some kind of **fossil** made the news, fueled by a common **misconception** about the estate.

The **autopsy** revealed the truth: a **fatal** fall, likely triggered by a structural **fracture** in the old staircase. The coroner's report, however, had found the deceased's **flesh** contained traces of a rare poison, indicating a foul play from the **outset**. The woman was said to have **suffered from one-sided love**, but, despite this, it was difficult for the authorities to discover the cause.

As I investigated, I came across a **cabin** in the wood. It looked like a **bungalow**, but inside, it was only able to contain a tiny table and a bed, with a window overlooking the scene. It was the place where the young woman used to spend her time, although, looking at the **filth**, the **fragrance** had been completely lost. She, the last person in the estate, had chosen this place to hide away from everyone.

The investigation was **futile** at first, a series of dead ends. Trying to interview the locals was **meaningless**: all they did was **make a fuss**. To **foresee** the outcome of such a situation seemed impossible, as if all efforts would just **fade into oblivion**. The woman's friends, fearing the consequences, had made their **farewell** after her **death**.

My **forte** wasn't solving mysteries; I was, in fact, quite **weak** when dealing with complex cases. I had a tendency to **stumble** over clues, making **foolish** assumptions. I felt **tired** and **frantic**. This entire case was becoming an **idiotic** endeavor, full of **fallacy**. I realized I was being a **moron**.

The owner, who was a **pioneer** in architectural design, had plans to **renovate** the manor. He wanted to **fortify** the structure and **furnish** it with **futuristic** technology. He intended to **decorate** it with exquisite art. However, the **brittle** state of the building made this seem impossible; any further damage would render it **useless**.

Eventually, I made an **inference**: Someone had a motive. It became clear: the owner, the only person who was able to enter the manor without a problem, was responsible.

In the end, justice prevailed. But the manor, despite being cleaned and revived, still bears the scars of that dark chapter.
