# The Unexpected Journey

The **downpour** started just as I finished the first **draft** of my novel. The persistent rain, coupled with my **doubtful** feelings about the story, made the day **difficult**. I often **loathe** writing; it sometimes feels like a **drag**, and I often want to **ignore** the task altogether.

The setting of my story was a **rural area**, a stark contrast to my **suburban area** life. The characters and plot, however, were rooted in **fantasy**, a world I hoped to **derive** inspiration from. I had been struggling to **reconcile** my initial ideas with the story's structure. There was a constant **Discord** in my mind about whether it would be successful. My **diagnosis** of writer's block was almost **definitive**.

I forced myself to **consider** the issues, though this would often **elicit** further self-criticism. I would **train** myself to focus; **extract** key themes; and **distil** the plot to its core. I had to **interpret** this feeling of **inadequacy**, and I was concerned that this **deficiency** would prevent my success.

The financial realities were **devastating**. The government was implementing a **Regressive tax** plan, and the situation had been **dictate** on my life. I felt like the rain was starting to **desert** me.

My **domestic** life offered an **abundance** of support, and I knew I needed to **elaborate** on the positive aspects of my life. My neighbor, who lived in the **downtown** area, had offered to **do a favor**, I would be able to **separate** the current problems from the story.

The next morning I found myself on the **pier**, looking towards the **port**. The sun began to **garnish with** a golden hue, a **dramatic** change from the day before. The **national** pride swelled within me as I realized that my **pipe dream** might have a chance to become a success.

Later, I decided to **extract** an **excerpt** from a book, and I **copy** this into my book. I was beginning to **ornament with** details, and I did not **discriminate** against any idea. I began to feel I could **endure** my difficulties, and the initial **determinate** idea began to transform. The project was starting to come together.

I hope one day I can use the experience to start a **debate**, and hope my **denomination** will be known! I felt I was now ready to **train** myself. I no longer felt my ability to write was as limited; I had not **fell into a drowse** anymore!
