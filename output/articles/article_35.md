## The **Decisive** Moment in the Tropical **Rainy Season**

The annual **rainy season** in this region is a time of both vibrant life and considerable challenge. One must **declare taxes** on their property to avoid legal trouble, but the heavy downpours and floods often **distract** from such mundane tasks. The government, trying to maintain order, often has to **discharge** officials for corruption, which then begins to **dissolve** the trust of the citizens. 

This year, however, the situation seemed especially precarious. A **dubious** rumor, spread by a small **faction**, had begun to gain traction. **Unlike** previous years, a sense of impending crisis hung in the air. This was further complicated by the sudden **emerge** of a **destructive insect**, threatening the crops.

The local leaders needed to act fast. Their **ultimate** goal was to maintain the **adequacy** of the food supply and to prevent a serious **dispute**. The problem was that the leaders could easily **put off** making any firm decisions. The citizens felt that the leaders could only **portray** themselves as competent people. They needed to choose the **decisive** path.

This was also not the time for games. Any attempt to create a **pun** in this situation would be considered **counterproductive**. Any new proposals would need to **indicate** how they could help resolve the crisis.

The governor had to **dictate** a new plan. He chose not to **disseminate** the details until the situation was clearer. The citizens, although feeling **desperate**, could only **deduce** that the governor would try to **extract** the truth. They were not going to be able to **replicate** any of the government's plans. They needed to be ready to **disengage** if necessary. This was a moment of truth. The only person they could trust was the governor himself.

The governor's advisors were a mixed bag. Some were **easy-going**, but others seemed **inactive** and unwilling to take any action. It was a challenging situation, one that required a **well-wrought** strategy. Any deviation from the plan could potentially **deform** the final outcome or **distort** the truth. 

The governor was determined to **explain** the situation to the people and **reveal** what was happening. He knew that the only way to get through this was to **drill** the key points home, again and again. The whole situation was now under control, he said. He would **despatch** the army and police officers. This action would also **commit** the army and police to their assigned tasks.

The governor had to **diagnose** the problem, find the solution and **signify** to the community how he would protect them. Any bad news would **expose** the truth, but he was determined to find the **distinct** solution.

He knew it was all about making sure the farmers didn't **freeze out**. He decided to **maneuver** the **diagonal** path, which was to **conscript** those of military age to **be drafted** for food production. He wouldn't let the food supply **dwarf**. He would prevent food shortages. His action was designed to show that he was not **unlike** the rest of the community.

The future was uncertain, but the governor's leadership was at stake. He needed to remain strong.
