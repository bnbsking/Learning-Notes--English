Due to the large-scale of the dataset, we have inadequate time to label the data as usual, after the discussion with my team, we finally perform iterative active learning which minimized the labeling efforts, and finish the project on time. Futher, I also used checked list and reported issue in time proactively, which also helps me to enhance the efficiency.",

        "answer": "I have some experience in sharing technical concepts with people who do not have a technical background. The key to success is to explain things step by step in a structured way and to provide real-life examples. For instance, when explaining the concept of precision and recall. High precision but low recall means that alerts are raised infrequently. This is similar to modern law in Taiwan, where if a person is convicted of a crime, it is very likely that they actually committed it. On the other hand, low precision but high recall means that alerts are raised very frequently. This is similar to the laws in Taiwan 50 years ago, when, in order to prevent Chinese spies, many people were convicted of crimes even though they had not actually committed them.",
