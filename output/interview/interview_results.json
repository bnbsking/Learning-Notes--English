        "question": "Question 1: Can you tell me about a time you had to work on a project with tight deadlines? How did you prioritize tasks and manage your time?",
        "answer": "Sure, a most representative project that i have experienced with tight deadline is the object detection on large-scale recycling data. Since the large-scale, we have inadequate time to label the data as usual, after the discussion with our team, we finally perform iteratively active learning which minimize the labeling efforts, and finish the project in time. Futher, I also used checked list and reported issue in time proactively, which also helps me to enhance the efficiency.",
        "model_answer": "In my role at Taiwan AILabs, I worked on a medical LLM service with a tight deadline. I prioritized tasks by impact, focusing on core functionality first. I used Agile methodologies, breaking the project into sprints, and daily stand-ups. This allowed for quick adaptation and efficient time management, ensuring we delivered on time.\n",

            "explanation": "The answer is relevant and provides a specific example of a project with tight deadlines. It mentions the use of active learning to address the time constraint related to data labeling. The answer also touches upon the use of checklists and proactive issue reporting for efficiency. However, the answer could be improved by providing more details on the specific tasks, the time allocated to each task, and how the candidate prioritized them. Also, the answer could also explain how the candidate managed their time, such as using a specific time management technique (e.g., Pomodoro) or tool, which can make the answer more complete."
